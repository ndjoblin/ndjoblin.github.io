  abstract  = {We study how a central authority of an economical area without tariffs will set up the level of taxes when there is imperfect competition. We consider a tax problem where in each country a distortionary commodity tax is used to solve distortions created by monopolistic competition, to finance a given level of public good, and for redistribution purposes. We find that at first-best, the level depends on two things: the degree of imperfect competition, but also on the relative valuation of leisure between countries (this is mainly taking into account for goods that are traded internationally): the central authority favors goods produced from goods with labor advantage, that is, it will encourage production in the country where the marginal social utility of leisure is lowest, by increasing subsidies for goods produced in this country.},
