Details on the course

This macroeconomics course covers two chapters. The first chapter focuses on the open economy and introduces the various variables that measure interactions between countries, such as exports and imports. It explores how these variables factor into the accounting identity of the GDP and demonstrates that net capital outflows/inflows are equal to the amount of the trade balance. Through this chapter, we analyze the impact of different policies and economic shocks on trade balance, capital flows, and exchange rates. The second part of the course delves into the Solow growth model. This chapter offers an evaluation of the effects of various shocks on capital accumulation and income levels. It explores how changes in factors like technology, population growth, and savings rates impact the short and long-term economic growth of economies.
