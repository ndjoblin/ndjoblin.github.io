  abstract  = {This paper explores the intricate relationship between taxation principles and cross-border labor dynamics in an increasingly integrated global economy. As countries
grapple with the implications of tax competition, we examine whether consumer
goods should be taxed in the country of production or consumption. The analysis
also extends to the emergence of skilled labor mobility, whose mobility has been
facilitated by evolving labor regulations and digital technology. In addition, firms are
internationally mobile without costs as taxes vary. By comparing the destination and
origin tax principles, we reveal that while the noncooperative destination principle
can achieve the first-best by neutralizing fiscal externalities, in the origin principle
persistent externalities lead the level of the noncooperative tax above the Pareto
efficient level.},
